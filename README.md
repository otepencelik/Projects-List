# Projects

**Real-Time Attention Distribution Behavior Analysis**, *2023 - 2024*

* Developing sequential machine learning models to analyze head orientation sequences from triadic conversations and provide real-time and retroactive feedback on attention distribution behavior, imitating a real behavioral coach. This work could help people in maintaining normative orientation behavior and navigating multi-party interactions which are very common in social and professional settings.

**Behavioral Intervention on Attention Distribution in Triadic Conversations [3]**, *2022*

* Conducted a behavioral intervention program for autistic individuals on attention distribution in triadic conversations using the head orientation estimation models from [1,2]. Most of the participants exhibited statistically significant improvements in attention distribution behavior compared to a control group.

**Body and Head Orientation Estimation using LiDAR Sensors [1, 2]**, *2019 - 2021*

* Developed a neural-network regression based real-time head and body orientation estimation system using low resolution 3D point cloud data from LiDAR sensors. Used hand-crafted features, random forest based recursive feature elimination and leave-one-out cross validation. The system achieves lower estimation errors compared to other models in similar experiment settings.

**Automated Trading**, *May 2021 – June 2024*                         

*	Implementing trading strategies to automatically trade stock and crypto assets. Worked mainly on the back-end, implementation, and back-testing.

*	Deployed multiple profitable trading strategies.

*	Developed a profitable football trading strategy which consistently beats closing line odds.

**SEIR Modeling of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States**, *Spring Term 2021*

* Augmented the SEIR model by [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/) with vaccination data and projections to assess the impact of vaccinations.

**Neural Image Captioning with a New Activation Function**, *Winter Term 2020*

*	Achieved comparable results on neural image captioning with a novel neural network activation function.

**Kobe Bryant Shot Selection Analysis**, *Winter Term 2020*

*	A thorough data analysis on all of Kobe Bryant's shots during his career.

**Housing Price Prediction**, *Fall Term 2019*

*	Implemented data-driven models to predict housing prices. 

**Speech and Voice Recognition on Android in Turkish**, *Oct 2018 – June 2019*

*	Developed a limited vocabulary speech and voice recognition application for Android devices. Lead the project, worked on the recognition model and Android application development. The industry partner is currently using the application on their receivers.

**Analyzing the Effects of Scanning Parameters on Magnetic Resonance Imaging**, *Spring Term 2019*

* Conducted an analysis on several MRI scanning parameters and their effects on different types of tissues.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging Simulation Tool**, *Fall Term 2018*

* Developed an MRI simulation tool which allows users to simulate various MRI settings and visualize outputs.

**Neural Image Captioning**, *Fall Term 2018*
